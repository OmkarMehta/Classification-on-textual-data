# Classification-on-textual-data by Supervised learning
Main purpose of this project is to understand different methods of classifying textual data. I've used "20 newsgroup" dataset. It is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic. 
Learning algorithms:
1. Linear Support Vector Machines
2. Support Vector Machine: Hard and Soft Margin
3. Naive Bayes Classifier: (i) Guassian Naive Bayes. (ii) Multinomial Naive Bayes. (iii) Bernoulli Naive Bayes
4. Logistic Regression

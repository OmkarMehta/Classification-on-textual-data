# Classification-on-textual-data
Main purpose of this project is to understand different methods of classifying textual data. I've used "20 newsgroup" dataset. It is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic.
